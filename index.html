            <h1>About Clock-5</h1>

            <p>The Clock-5 project was a testament to design creativity and practical problem-solving. Initially developed for <a href="https://inkcase.com/" style="color: yellow;">InkCase</a>, an iPhone case with an E-ink screen, Clock-5 aimed to optimize battery life while offering a valuable user experience.
            </p>
            <p>The challenge at hand was to reduce battery consumption, particularly during screen refreshes. E-ink technology, known for its energy-efficient properties, consumes battery power only when the screen refreshes. To address this, I conceptualized and designed the Clock-5â€”a clock that refreshed its display only once every 5 minutes, as opposed to the traditional one-minute intervals. This seemingly small adjustment had a significant impact on conserving battery power.
            </p>
            <p>What set Clock-5 apart was its unique approach to timekeeping. Instead of providing minute-by-minute precision, it offered users a convenient 5-minute time window. Whether indicating 4:01 pm or 4:05 pm, this design empowered users to estimate time effectively, aiding in better time management.
            </p>
            <p>This project served as a prime example of design creativity's ability to solve real-world challenges. By leveraging graphic design principles, I contributed to technology optimization, resulting in a product that enhanced user experiences while reducing energy consumption. The Clock-5 project illustrated how design could have a tangible and positive impact on device functionality and usability.</p>
